## 📁 Step 5: Configure Your Project and Section

The extension now allows you to customize where property tasks are added!

### Default Behavior (Recommended for New Users)
- **Project**: Inbox (default Todoist inbox)
- **Section**: None
- **No setup required** - works immediately after adding your API token

### Custom Project Setup (Optional)

1. **Access project configuration**:
   - In the extension options, scroll to **"Project & Section"**
   - This section is only available after adding a valid API token

2. **Choose your project**:
   - Select from the dropdown: **"Inbox (Default)"** or any of your Todoist projects
   - Example: Create and select **"Real Estate"** or **"Property Research"**

3. **Choose your section** (optional):
   - If you selected a project (not Inbox), you can choose a section
   - Example: **"To Review"**, **"Interesting Properties"**, or **"Follow Up"**
   - Leave as **"No section"** if you don't use sections

4. **Save your configuration**:
   - Click **"Save Configuration"**
   - You'll see confirmation: **"Configuration saved: [Project] → [Section]"**

### Configuration Examples

| Use Case | Project | Section | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Simple** | Inbox (Default) | - | Tasks go to main inbox |
| **Organized** | Real Estate | To Review | Tasks go to "Real Estate" project, "To Review" section |
| **Minimal Project** | Property Search | No section | Tasks go to "Property Search" project, no section |

### Legacy Users
If you previously used the extension with the hardcoded "Akquise" project, it will automatically work with your existing setup until you configure a new project.

## ✅ Step 6: Test the Extension

1. **Visit ImmoMetrica**:
   - Go to [immometrica.com](https://www.immometrica.com)
   - Browse to any property listing
   - The URL should look like: `immometrica.com/de/offer/12345`

2. **Add your first property**:
   - Click the extension icon in your toolbar
   - Watch for the status badge:
     - 🔄 **Processing** (gray) - Extension is working
     - ✅ **Saved** (green) - Property added successfully!
     - ✅ **Already Added** (green) - Property was already in your Todoist

3. **Check Todoist**:
   - Go to your Todoist project
   - You should see the property title as a new task
   - The task description contains the ImmoMetrica URL
   - The city is added as a label (if detected)

## 🎯 Understanding the Badges

The extension shows small badges on the icon to indicate status:

- ✅ **Green checkmark**: Task successfully added or already exists
- ✓ **Gray checkmark**: Task was already completed
- 🔄 **Gray circle**: Processing your request
- ❌ **Red X**: Error occurred
- 🔗 **Red chain**: Not on a valid property page
- 🔑 **Orange key**: API token needed
- 📁 **Orange folder**: Project setup needed

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "API token not configured" (🔑)
- **Problem**: No token saved or token invalid
- **Solution**: Follow Step 3 and 4 again, make sure you copy the full token

### "Project not found" (📁)
- **Problem**: Can't find "Akquise" project
- **Solution**: Create the project in Todoist or configure different project in extension options

### "Not on valid page" (🔗)
- **Problem**: Extension only works on ImmoMetrica property pages
- **Solution**: Navigate to a property listing (URL contains `/offer/`)

### "Network error"
- **Problem**: Can't connect to Todoist
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and try again

### Extension icon missing
- **Problem**: Extension not properly installed
- **Solution**: 
  - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
  - Make sure the extension is enabled (toggle is blue)
  - Try disabling and re-enabling it
